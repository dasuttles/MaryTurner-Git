The Mary Turner Project</div>


<div id="text">
<p class="whynow">The <b>Mary Turner Project &#40;MTP&#41;</b> is a diverse, grassroots volunteer collective of 
students, educators, and 
local community members who are committed to racial justice and racial healing.  That commitment involves educating ourselves 
and others about the presence of racism, the multiple forms of racism, and the effects of racism, so that
we may become involved in eliminating racism. Much of our work centers on research driven community engagement and action relevative to past and current
racial injustice. The group meets monthly, sponsors two to three
major events annually, and currently is working on three iniatives.   The first of those includes the creation of a free, searchabld, web based
database on U.S. slavery.   The second initiative involves the creation of a free, searchable database on all known lynchings in the U.S.  And our
third initiative involves a collaborative campaign to engage state sponsored Confederate culture in Georgia.

</p> 
<p>As part of our ongoing work, the MTP also organizes an annual Mary Turner Commemoration each May.  That multiracial, multigenerational event is attended by people from all over the country.
It involves a shared meal, a short program, reflections from the descendants of the 1918 lynching victims, and a caravan out to the site of Mary Turner's murder.
There the group shares thoughts, poetry, song and prayers.   The public is always invited to this historic event which takes place in Hahira, Georgia.  
Below are a few scenes from the 2010 gathering.</p>For more information about this event simply send us an 
<a href="mailto:info@vmaryturner.org">email</a>.

<br> <br><br> <br>
 <p><b><font size="3">Current Work</font></b>
<ul>
<li>In partnership with the Lowndes/Valdosta Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the MTP recently launched the "Its Hate Not Heritage" campaign.  
That initiative seeks to end all state promotion and funding of 
Confederate holidays, Confederate events, the naming of roads after Confederate leaders, and the state management of Confederate historic sites.
The campaign was launched 
with the issuing of an <a href="http://www.maryturner.org/openletter.pdf" 
    target="_blank">open letter to Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal and Georgia lawmakers</a>. 
The MTP is currently reaching out to relevant organizations across 
    the south and nation for help with this initiative so we hope you will get involved and spread the word.  For more information visit our
    <a href="http://www.maryturner.org/campaign.htm" target="_blank">campaign
    webpage</a>.


</li><br>

<li>The MTP is currently working to digitize the 1860 U.S. Slave Schedules in order to create a free, searchable database at
<a href="http://www.slavecensus.com/" target="_blank"> www.slavecensus.com</a> that the public can use to 
search their ancestorial names.  This project was started because we have repeatedly heard that people lack the access or resources
to see if their ancestors owned enslaved people or were enslaved.  Currently we have more than 30 volunteers from all across the nation working on this project and
it is being developed in collaboration with 
<a href="http://www.valdosta.edu/academics/library/depts/archives-and-special-collections/" target="_blank">Valdosta 
State University's Archives Department.</a> In addition to enabling people to search family names, the public will also be
able to download data for whole counties in Georgia from this site.  We are in need of volunteers for this project so if you might be interested please 
click this 
<a href="http://www.maryturner.org/slavecensusproject.htm" target="_blank">link</a>. We would also like to expand the project to cover
all former slave holding states in the South so please 
<a href="mailto:info@maryturner.org">let us know</a> if you live in another state and might want to partner on this historic project. 

</li><br>
<li>The MTP is in the process of creating a national, searchable database on more than 2,600 documented lynchings in the U.S.  That database will enable the public to search 
lynching victims by name, year, location, race, gender,
mob type, and alledged crime.  It will be housed on the <a href="http://www.maryturner.org/database.htm" target="_blank">MTP website</a>.</li><br>

<li>Several MTP members are currently producing a documentary film which exams Confederate culture in the 
region. That project is in its second year of filming and the release date for the film will be some time in the Spring of 2015. </li><br>

<li>When requested, the MTP regularly conducts research for the descendants of individuals who were the 
victims of racial terrorism in the region.  The MTP does that work given its access to historical documents
and scholarly resources. </li><br>

<li>Researching and community organizing around assorted public forums related to racial equity and healing.  Our
most recent forum centered on unearthing the scope and scale of slavery in South Georgia and was held on April 1st, 2014.</li>
<br>
<li>Researching and community organizing around all forms of racism (i.e. cultural,
instituional, individual, environmental) in order to address and elminate each form.</li><br>

<li>Networking and sharing information with other <a href="http://www.maryturner.org/links.htm" target="_blank">

similar groups</a> in the state and nation.</li><br>

 <p ><b><font size="3">Project Accomplishments</font></b></p>



<p>The development of the Mary Turner website that you are now visiting. 
  This site has experienced thousands of visits and has made the story of Mary Turner and the other 
  victims of 1918 available to the world.  
  The MTP hopes to expand the website in the near future to 
include digitalized copies of all historical documents related to the Mary Turner story and other lynchings
in the region.  We are also in the process of adding slides and video from assorted MTP events.</p>
 
 
<p>The MTP has distributed hundreds of 
<a href="http://www.maryturner.org/images/MTPpamphlet.pdf" target="_blank">
pamphlets</a> throughout the 
university and the local community chronicling the saga of Mrs. 
Turner and the events of 1918.  Those pamphlets have and continue 
to be circulated in the Southeast and are now available on the MTP documents webpage. 
The MTP plans to produce a more detailed publication that that can be used to educate students in
local and regional schools about the racial history of the region.</p>

align="right" align="top" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" style="margin:5px 15px"/>Members have presented the story of Mary Turner and the work of the MTP at
more than 40 local and regional events.  Consequently, the story of Mary Turner and the events of 1918 are now common knowledge
among area citizens.  In 2009 students from the MTP presented the Mary Turner story at Valdosta State University's Undergraduate Research Symposium and the 2009 Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) annual State Convention. They, in addition to more than 150 other Valdosta State
students, also attended and petitioned the <a href="http://www.valdostacity.com" target="_blank">City of Valdosta</a>
to help with the erection of a memorial to Mary Turner.</p> 
 
<p>That same year Valdosta State faculty members secured a $1000 university sponsored research grant.  
Those funds enabled Dr. Tracy Woodard Myers to conduct further research at the Georgia Archives on the Turner family and 
the potential economic consequences of lynching. </p> 
 

 


<p>Throughout 2009 the MTP compiled and provided historical document packets for descendents of
the Turner family.   Research was also done and provided to members of the Will Head family.
Members of both families reciprocated by sharing the information they had 
with the MTP in addition to becoming supporters of the project.  </p>

<p> 
The MTP organized a truly historic memorial service on May 17th, 2009 for 
Mary Turner and the other victims of the 1918 lynching rampage.  
More than 130 community and family members attended the service where 
family members shared their stories, members of the MTP discussed the purpose and work
of their group, and the upcoming installation of the historical marker was announced. In addition to 
breaking bread together at the local community center, a motorcade of more than 50 cars drove to
the site of Mary Turner's murder for prayer and to reflect on the events of 1918.

In 2009 MTP members raised $1500 and successfully petitioned for the installation of a state sponsored 
historical marker documenting
the events of May 1918.  The MTP also 
gained approval from the Georgia Department of Transportation for the location of  that
marker. After negotiating with Georgia Historical Society 
regarding what the text of the marker would state, the completed marker was installed and dedicated in 2010.</p>

In response to area fraternities displaying the confederate flag, on September 28, 2009 the MTP organized   
 <a href="http://www.maryturner.org./flagforum.htm" target="_blank">"Heritage, Hate, or Fear, A Community Discussion about 
Southern Symbols and Their Meaning"</a> &#40;click for video from the event&#41;. 
This public forum was organized to discuss the use of the Confederate flag by local fraternities at Valdosta State University.  More than 125 students, faculty, and community members
attended to dialog and get information about the history of this devisive symbol, student's free 
speech rights, why many people don't know the history of this symbol, and its impact 
on multicultural affairs and race relations

On March 30, 2010 the MTP organized "Exploring the Political Climate Since
the Election of President Barack Obama."</a> This public forum was organized to 
discuss the contemporary political climate and what that climate reveals about us as a nation.  Panelists included VSU faculty, representatives
from the local Republican and Democratic parties, as well as a number of local community leaders.  The goal of the event was to 
have constructive dialog about where we are politically as a community/nation and whether current differences reflect ongoing 
racial animosities

caravaned out the the historic marker for song, prayer, and reflections.   This year was especially powerful because the Graham/Grant families 
(the descendants of Mary Turner) had their family reunion the same weekend and coordinated
